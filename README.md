# Game-Of-Life
A python implementation of the famous Conway's Game of Life.

After watching a Game Jam Youtube video, I remembered the existence of Conway's Game of Life and decided to try creating a python script to play it. This code only requires `Matplotlib` and `Numpy` to run. This was a very interesting challenge, especially to associate interactivity to build the initial conditions with animations to see the evolution. It is also possible to reset the board, pause and resume the animation, and of course quit the simulation.

It could possibly need some adjustements and optimization but I am so far extremely happy about the result. The next step is to find a way to compile this project into an executable for anyone to run this script.
